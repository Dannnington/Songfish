# Reference document for proctors

### Override Codes
Override codes are used to change the behaviour of the bot and override its' production behaviours. Only proctors are able to use these override codes.

Override codes can be activated by entering the override code into the `play` command.

#### List of overrides

- `<songfish::override::stop>` - Stops the song immediately, bypassing any [current and future] restrictions like DJ-only mode or vote-control.

- `<songfish::overide::houston>` - **Houston, we have a problem.** This override code shuts down the bot and crashes it.
